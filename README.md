# HandWritten_Digit_Identification
Identification (prediction) of hand written digit images using Artificial Neural Network.
Run the ex3_nn.m file.
Data is provided in ex3data1.mat.
5000 hand written images are given. Each image is divided into 20x20 pixels,i.e.,400 pixels per image.
X is a 5000x400 matrix, with each row depicting an image from the dataset.
y is a matrix having 5000-dimensional matrix that contains labels for the training set.
